  <h3>Review of Machine Learning in Robotic Grasping Control in Space Application</h3>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This article presents a comprehensive survey of the integration of machine learning techniques into robotic grasping, with a special emphasis on the challenges and advancements for space applications. The incorporation of artificial intelligence, particularly through deep learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks, has significantly revolutionized robotic grasping. These advancements facilitate autonomous, efficient, and sophisticated manipulation in the challenging environment of outer space, transitioning from traditional mechanical grippers to sophisticated systems powered by advanced algorithms. This transition highlights the critical integration of sensory perception, grasp planning, and execution mechanisms, enhancing robots' capabilities to perceive, interact with, and manipulate objects with unprecedented precision and adaptability. The article meticulously outlines significant advancements achieved through the deployment of convolutional neural networks for visual information processing, RNNs for sequential decision-making, RL for autonomous strategy refinement, and transfer learning for leveraging pre-learned knowledge in novel tasks. These technologies address the unique challenges of space environments, such as varied textures, occlusions, microgravity conditions, and the sim-to-real gap, by enhancing sample efficiency, improving sim-to-real transfer capabilities, and integrating multimodal data for better object localization and pose estimation. Furthermore, the review explores the specific challenges faced in space robotic grasping, including handling varied textures and occlusions, adapting to unpredictable conditions, achieving real-time processing, and ensuring safety and reliability. It proposes future research directions focused on overcoming these hurdles, such as enhanced generalization through multimodal learning, robust sim-to-real transfer techniques, and the development of collaborative robotics and swarm intelligence. Critical to the development of ML models for robotic grasping are the roles of specialized datasets and simulation environments. Datasets like the Cornell Grasping Dataset and the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object, along with simulation platforms such as Gazebo and PyBullet, provide essential resources for training, testing, and refining ML models. These tools enable researchers to simulate complex robotic systems and interactions within realistic environments, fostering rapid iterations on design and control strategies. In summary, this article offers in-depth insights into the progress, current challenges, and future prospects of machine learning techniques in robotic grasping for space exploration. It showcases significant strides made in the field and charts a path forward, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to navigate the complexities of robotic manipulation in outer space. Through the strategic integration of advanced ML techniques, the development of adaptable and efficient robotic systems for space applications continues to advance, promising to unlock new possibilities in space exploration and beyond.</p>
